# SCHOLAR_RISC-V MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT support

This repository contains the necessary files to configure and use the [MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/mpfs-disco-kit) from Microchip with the [SCHOLAR RISC-V](https://github.com/Kawanami-git/SCHOLAR_RISC-V) processor.

It is intended to be used as a submodule of the SCHOLAR RISC-V GitHub repository, and cannot be used independently.

## üß† Overview

**SCHOLAR_RISC-V** is a learning-oriented project designed to guide you step-by-step through the inner workings of a processor, using the RISC-V architecture as a foundation.

In addition to simulation, SCHOLAR_RISC-V aims to be usable on several development boards, including the **MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT** from Microchip.

This repository provides all the necessary files to:
- Configure the MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT (bootloader, Linux).
- Build a valid SCHOLAR_RISC-V bitstream and load it on the FPGA.

<br>

## üß≠ Project Organization

This repository will be updated as needed to support the evolution of the SCHOLAR RISC-V project.

Only the `main` branch is meaningful; it contains all the necessary source files to:
- Configure the MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT development board.
- Load and validate the SCHOLAR RISC-V processor on the .

## üìÇ Structure

- **[`HSS/`](./HSS/)**  
  Contains the [Microchip Hart Software Services](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/hart-software-services), including the source files for the FSBL (First Stage Bootloader).

- **[`Linux/meta-mchp/`](./Linux/meta-mchp/)**  
  Contains the [Microchip Yocto layers](https://github.com/linux4microchip/meta-mchp), which provide the source files for building the SSBL (Second Stage Bootloader) and the Linux system.

- **[`Linux/meta-scholar-risc-v/`](./Linux/meta-scholar-risc-v/)**  
  Contains overlay files that add specific features to the base Yocto build for the MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT.

- **[`FPGA/`](./FPGA/)**  
  FPGA implementation files for the **Microchip PolarFire SoC Discovery Kit**, enabling the SCHOLAR RISC-V core to be synthesized and run on hardware.

- **[`scripts/`](./scripts/)**  
  A set of useful scripts to build and load the HSS, the Linux system, and to communicate with the Discovery Kit board.

## üìö Documentation

Full documentation is available in the [SCHOLAR RISC-V project repository](https://github.com/Kawanami-git/SCHOLAR_RISC-V/tree/main/docs/hardware_integration/MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT/).

<br>

## üì¶ Dependencies

All dependencies are explicitly described in the [SCHOLAR_RISC-V project ‚Äì Hardware Integration](https://github.com/Kawanami-git/SCHOLAR_RISC-V/tree/main/docs/hardware_integration/MPFS_DISCOVERY_KIT/) directory.

<br>

## üêû Known Issues

Yocto may occasionally fail to fetch some external dependencies, which can lead to a build failure. <br>
If this happens, simply rerun the build process **without cleaning** it. <br>
Yocto will resume from where it left off and attempt to fetch the missing files again.
